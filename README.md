# Nexter 

You can access the live demo of Nexter [here](https://nexter-grid-project.vercel.app/).

Nexter is a project I created while learning SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets) and exploring how to build a complete website layout using only CSS grid.

I implemented an 8-grid column approach for the entire layout and utilized nested grids within each section for better organization.

Designing the entire layout using CSS grid is a common practice in modern web design.
